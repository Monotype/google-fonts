Description	Macintosh	Roman	English	Matthew Carter is one of the most-praised type designers of our time. His work ranges from newspaper typefaces for Mergenthaler Linotype to the condensed sans typeface now used more than any other in re-designed telephone books. His Galliard became one of the most popular new text faces of the last 20 years. Now we have Elephant and its italic, a careful re-working of a traditional English extra-bold serif style. Originally, Elephant appeared in posters, often alternating from roman to italic on successive lines. In Europe, faces of this kind still may be used in very small sizes for telephone numbers in letterheads and business cards. Today, the best use of Elephant is for an eye-catching word. Even a single quote will draw the reader's eye to where it is placed.	(1, 0, 0, 10)
