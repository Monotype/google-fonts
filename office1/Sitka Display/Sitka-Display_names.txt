Description	Macintosh	Roman	English	Sitka is a family of optically scaled typefaces. Each of its six styles has been designed to excel at a specific size. The smaller styles are workhorses, highly legible in text, with sturdy structures and generous spacing. At the upper end of the size range Sitka’s styles have a warm and elegant personality with the narrower forms and tighter spacing appropriate for display. Used in concert, the Sitka typeface family brings readability, visual interest and typographic consistency to the page and screen.  ¶ In a new and unique methodology, scientific legibility studies were directly integrated into the Sitka design process. Different versions of each letter were tested in recognition studies, and the results were incorporated into the final design.  ¶ This approach of combining science, technology, and craftsmanship to produce an excellent reading experience on screen was pioneered at Microsoft by Bill Hill. As a member of the Typography and Advanced Reading Technology teams, Bill revolutionized on-screen typography by championing the creation of the OpenType specification, ClearType rendering technology, and landmark typefaces such as Verdana, Georgia, Calibri, and Meiryo. Microsoft’s typography teams dedicate the Sitka family of typefaces to the memory of Bill Hill and his vision of Reading 2.0. His passion and values live on in the design of this typeface family.
