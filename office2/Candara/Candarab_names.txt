Description	Unicode	Unicode 2.0 and onwards semantics, Unicode BMP only ('cmap' subtable formats 0, 4, 6)	ID 0 is OK. No languages specified for Unicode platform.	Candara is a casual humanist sans with verticals showing a graceful entasis on stems, high-branching arcades in the lowercase, large apertures in all open forms, and unique ogee curves on diagonals. The resultant texture is lively but not intrusive, and makes for a  friendly and readable text.	(0, 3, 0, 10)
