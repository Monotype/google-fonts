Description	Unicode	Unicode 2.0 and onwards semantics, Unicode BMP only ('cmap' subtable formats 0, 4, 6)	ID 0 is OK. No languages specified for Unicode platform.	Constantia is a modulated wedge-serif typeface designed primarily for continuous text in both electronic and paper publishing. The design responds to the recent narrowing of the gap between screen readability and traditional print media, exploiting specific aspects of the most recent advances in ClearType rendering, such as sub-pixel positioning. The classic proportions of relatively small x-height and long extenders make Constantia ideal for book and journal publishing, while the slight squareness and open counters ensure that it remains legible even at small sizes.
