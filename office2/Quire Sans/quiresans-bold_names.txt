Description	Macintosh	Roman	English	Quire Sans is a typeface family designed by the Jim Ford. It consists of 10 weights plus Italics. The families look and feel can be described as: Friendly or serious - depending on the context - understated, sturdy and graceful. The forms are based on classic Roman lines and proportions, so it‘s naturally very legible. Quire Sans is rooted in traditional book typography and draws inspiration from centuries of typographic development. All wrapped up in a fresh and tidy family for modern media.	(1, 0, 0, 10)
