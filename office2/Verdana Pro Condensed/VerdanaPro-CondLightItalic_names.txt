Description	Windows	Unicode BMP	English (United States)	The Verdana™ typeface family was created specifically to address the challenges of on-screen display. Designed by world renowned type designer Matthew Carter, and hand-tuned by leading hinting expert, Tom Rickner, these sans serif fonts are unique examples of type designed for reading on a computer screen.    Verdana Pro is a major update to the Verdana family. Developed by The Font Bureau, Monotype Imaging and Matthew Carter, Verdana Pro extends the original family of four fonts to 20 fonts in total. The Verdana Pro and Verdana Pro Condensed families each contain 10 fonts: Light, Regular, Semibold, Bold and Black (each with matching italic styles). These enhanced fonts provide typographic flexibility for use in both on screen and in print.    Verdana Pro includes a variety of advanced typographic features including true small capitals, ligatures, fractions, old style figures, lining tabular figures and lining proportional figures. An OpenType-savvy application is required to access these typographic features. Verdana Pro contains over 800 glyphs with extensive language support including Codepage 1252 Latin 1, Codepage 1250 Latin 2 Eastern Europe, Codepage 1253 Greek, Codepage 1251 Cyrillic, Codepage 1254 Turkish, Codepage 1257 Baltic.
